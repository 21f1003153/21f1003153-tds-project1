Here’s a simple yet functional standalone HTML + JavaScript app that displays a brief and a list of attachments on a web page. This example uses inline JavaScript and minimal styling for clarity and simplicity.


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Attachment Viewer App</title>
<style>
    body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; padding: 20px; }
    h1 { color: #333366; }
    #brief { margin-bottom: 20px; }
    .attachment { margin-top: 10px; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Attachment Viewer App</h1>
    <div id="brief">Brief description of the project:</div>
    <div id="attachmentList">List of Attachments:</div>

    <script>
        // JavaScript code to append the brief and build the list of attachments.
        document.getElementById('brief').innerHTML += 'This is a simple app designed to display a project brief and a list of attachments.';

        var attachments = [
            { name: "Attachment1.pdf", size: "150KB" },
            { name: "ImageFile.png", size: "300KB" },
            { name: "Document.docx", size: "200KB" }
        ];

        var attachmentListDiv = document.getElementById('attachmentList');

        attachments.forEach(function(attachment) {
            var attachmentDiv = document.createElement('div');
            attachmentDiv.className = 'attachment';
            attachmentDiv.innerHTML = `Name: ${attachment.name}, Size: ${attachment.size}`;
            attachmentListDiv.appendChild(attachmentDiv);
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>


Features of this app:
- **HTML**: It sets up the document structure, including the introduction of style elements for basic layout and formatting.
- **CSS**: Styles included in a `<style>` tag to keep the colors and spacing visually appealing and readable.
- **JavaScript (inline)**: This is included in a `<script>` tag. The JavaScript dynamically inserts a brief of the project and lists each attachment with details. This data handling demonstrates a crucial aspect of JavaScript when manipulating the DOM based on data models (in this case, an array of objects).
- **No external libraries or APIs**: This ensures that it functions standalone without dependencies.
  
Each attachment’s details (name and size) are rendered in the browser, allowing users to see what files are associated with the project. This setup is minimalistic while providing a practical demonstration of essential web development techniques.
