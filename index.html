Here is a minimal, working single-page HTML + JavaScript app that displays a brief and an attachment list. This example demonstrates how to create a simple user interface with HTML and provide functionality to display data using JavaScript.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Brief and Attachments</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            margin: 20px;
        }
        h1 {
            color: #333;
        }
        ul {
            list-style-type: none;
            padding: 0;
        }
        li {
            margin: 5px 0;
        }
        .attachment {
            font-weight: bold;
            color: #007BFF;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Brief and Attachments</h1>
    <h2>Brief</h2>
    <p id="brief"></p>
    <h2>Attachments</h2>
    <ul id="attachmentList"></ul>

    <script>
        // Brief and attachment list data
        const data = {
            brief: "This is a brief description of the project. It outlines the main objectives and requirements.",
            attachments: [
                { name: "Project Proposal.pdf", url: "#" },
                { name: "Budget.xlsx", url: "#" },
                { name: "Timeline.docx", url: "#" },
            ]
        };

        // Display brief
        document.getElementById('brief').textContent = data.brief;

        // Display attachment list
        const attachmentList = document.getElementById('attachmentList');
        data.attachments.forEach(attachment => {
            const li = document.createElement('li');
            li.innerHTML = `<span class="attachment">${attachment.name}</span> (<a href="${attachment.url}" target="_blank">Download</a>)`;
            attachmentList.appendChild(li);
        });
    </script>

</body>
</html>
```

### How It Works:
1. **HTML Structure**: The document defines a basic layout with headings and sections for the brief and attachment list.
2. **Styling**: Basic CSS styles are included for better readability.
3. **JavaScript Logic**:
   - A `data` object contains the brief and an array of attachments.
   - The brief text is displayed in a `<p>` element, and each attachment is added to the list as a list item (`<li>`).
   - Attachments are structured as clickable links (though they currently link to `#`).

This example can be easily expanded or modified based on requirements. You can replace the attachment URLs with actual download links if needed.
